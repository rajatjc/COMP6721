# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection and Classification using Different Models

Abstract
--------

This report presents a study on the detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy using different models. Diabetic retinopathy is a condition that affects diabetic patients and can lead to vision impairment and blindness if left untreated. The objective of this project is to develop an automated system for accurately identifying the stage of diabetic retinopathy.

A dataset containing 35,126 retinal scan images was utilized, obtained from the Diabetic Retinopathy Detection competition on Kaggle. Various pre-trained deep-learning models were employed to classify the retinal images into different stages of diabetic retinopathy. The achieved results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in accurately detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy.

This research provides healthcare professionals with a reliable tool for early intervention and management of diabetic retinopathy.
